# Experiments with cozy-desktop

This repository is a place where I can put ideas and experiments on how to
improve the desktop client for Cozy Cloud. Currently, I am trying to rewrite a
client in Go with an emphasis on tests and simulation.

## What would be needed for a full client

There are a lot of things that are out of the scope for this proof of concept.
This work would be needed if we want to release a new desktop client for Cozy
users:

- Support of Windows and macOS
- UI
- packagingn auto-update, and auto-start
- logs, sentry, and a way to contact the support team
- documentation
- use the trash of the local computer
- managing errors like cozy blocked or moved to a new address
- quota on the Cozy, and no more space on the local disk
- opening cozy-notes
- etc.
