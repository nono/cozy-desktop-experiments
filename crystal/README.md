# cozy-desktop.cr

Try Crystal programming language by writing a desktop client for Cozy Cloud
that synchronizes files.

This is a proof of concept, with a lot of limitations. Don't use for anything
else that some tests, or have backups.

## What would be needed for a full client

There are a lot of things that are out of the scope for this proof of concept.
This work would be needed if we want to release a new desktop client for Cozy
users:

- Add support of Windows and macOS
- add UI
- add online/offline status
- manage dates and executable for files
- improve the code to make it more robust
- add logs and a way to contact the support team
- use sentry to report errors
- fix the TODOs in code
- add more tests (a lot, manual and automatic)
- packaging, auto-update, auto-start
- use the trash of the local computer
- alert the user when the disk space is full (both cozy and hard drive)
- https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/blob/master/core/config/.cozyignore
- https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/blob/master/core/remote/warning_poller.js
- use the XDG user-directories for config & co
- use a specific User-Agent
- refresh the OAuth tokens
- update the version of the registered OAuth2 client
- call the `/settings/synchronized` endpoint
- managing correctly the several dates for each file
- handling `.cozy-note` files
- updating the dependencies with renovate or dependabot
- write more documentation and publish it (`crystal docs`) on GitHub pages
- use extended attributes on linux to detect inode reuses for operations when the client is stopped
- etc.

## Installation

You will need to [install Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) and run:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:nono/cozy-desktop.cr.git
$ cd cozy-desktop.cr
$ make
$ ./bin/cozy-desktop-ng --help
```

## Usage

You can use these commands to play with a local cozy instance:

```sh
$ cd cozy-desktop.cr
$ mkdir -p tmp
$ cozy-stack serve
$ cozy-stack instances add cozy.tools:8080 --passphrase cozy --apps home,store,drive,settings --email foo@cozy.tools --public-name Foo
$ cozy-stack instances client-oauth --json cozy.tools:8080 http://localhost:1234/ 'Cozy Fuse' github.com/nono/cozy-fuse
$ cozy-stack instances token-oauth cozy.tools:8080 <client-id> io.cozy.files
$ cozy-stack instances refresh-token-oauth cozy.tools:8080 <client-id> io.cozy.files
$ ./bin/cozy-desktop-ng configure --dir ./tmp/Cozy --cozy cozy.tools:8080 --token <token>
$ ./bin/cozy-desktop-ng sync
$ ls -alr ./tmp/Cozy
```

## Development

Some useful commands can be found in the Makefile. You can list them with `make
help`.
